# Bank Teller

### Welcome to the Bank Teller program, written in Java!

This program represents a bank teller system that updates bank accounts and maintains a database of transactions and teller information. Each bank teller is represented by a separate thread to ensure that transactions are not processed twice.

The program has the following features:

Account updating: The bank tellers can update the accounts of customers by adding or withdrawing funds as needed.

Transaction database: The program maintains a database of all transactions made by the bank tellers. This includes information such as the account number, the transaction amount, and the date and time of the transaction.
